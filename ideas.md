## Response 1: Romantic Minimalism (Probability: 0.08)

**Design Movement:** Contemporary Romantic Minimalism inspired by luxury greeting cards and intimate digital experiences

**Core Principles:**
- Whitespace as breathing room—generous margins and vertical rhythm create an intimate, unhurried feel
- Emotional typography hierarchy—large, bold display text for key moments paired with delicate serif accents
- Subtle depth through layering—soft shadows and translucent overlays create dimension without clutter
- Restrained color palette with strategic accent colors for emotional impact

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Warm cream/off-white (#F8F6F3) as the canvas—soft, inviting, non-clinical
- Accent: Deep rose gold (#C97C7C) for emotional warmth and connection
- Secondary: Muted sage green (#9BA89B) for balance and growth
- Text: Charcoal (#2C2C2C) for readability with rose gold highlights for key moments

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric vertical scroll with staggered sections—left-aligned text, right-aligned imagery creates visual rhythm
